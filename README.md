# This is retired
- Honestly, I got sick of working on this project. It became too gimmicky and accumulated so much technical debt I just resented working on it.
- I'm working on a new website, something simpler and more practical. It's unfortunate because I really liked the idea - but any further development will just feel like sunk-cost. 


### Outer Wilds themed Portfolio Website
- I opted for a ThreeJS website as I wanted to make a portfolio website with more charm than just some static HTML pages, additionally, I wanted to learn the library for future web-game projects I have in mind.
- ThreeJS also allows me to emulate workflows from other projects, meaning I could get into flow a lot quicker despite learning a new tool.
- As a bonus, using ThreeJS minimises the amount of HTML and CSS I have to write, meaning I can focus purely on coding and not markdown gymnastics.

### Inspiration:
- I just so happened to be watching a lot of lore content for the game when I started this project and took a lot of inspiration to make a website themed after it.
- I wanted to make sure the design wasn't too niche and abstract - where only a select amount of people could see it and go "that's a cool design". This was another reason I went with Outer Wilds as my inspiration, instead of a game like Terraria or Risk of Rain 2.

### TODO:
- Figure out what to do for other planets 
- Loading animation
- 3D Models for planets
- Container for titles in projects so it doesn't scroll with project cards
